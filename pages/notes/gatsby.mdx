# Gatsby

- [Recipes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-04-15-announcing-gatsby-recipes/)
  - Allow you to install NPM packages, add Gatsby plugins, generate pages and other code. Recipes are written using markdown and React components (MDX).
  - What if tutorials **were** Recipes but could be still read as tutorials **and** run as Recipes where they’d walk you through setting up sites, adding technologies and services, etc.
  - [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) allows you to build CLIs with React. It makes building data-driven CLI apps **much** more approachable than other methods we’ve tried.
- Plugins
