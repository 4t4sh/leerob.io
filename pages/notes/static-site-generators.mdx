- [[Server-Side Rendering]]
  - You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose [[Static-Site Generators]].
  - On the other hand, [[Static-Site Generators]] are **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.
- [[Data Fetching Strategies]]
  - Just HTML – whether created manually or through [[Static-Site Generators]].
