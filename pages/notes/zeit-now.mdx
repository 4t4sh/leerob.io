# ZEIT Now

- ZEIT Now is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions.
- [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/) is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to ZEIT Now, the following happens by default:
  - Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the [ZEIT Now Smart CDN](https://zeit.co/smart-cdn), which is blazingly fast.
  - Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated [Serverless Functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction). This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
- ​ZEIT Now has many more features, such as:
  - **Custom Domains:** Once deployed on ZEIT Now, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at [our documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains) here.
  - **Environment Variables:** You can also set environment variables on ZEIT Now. Take a look at [our documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) here. You can then [use those environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/environment-variables) in your Next.js app.
  - **Automatic HTTPS:** HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.
