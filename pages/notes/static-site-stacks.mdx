# Static Site Stacks

- React
  - [[Next.js]] (Static pages, API routes, deployed on [[ZEIT Now]])
    - API Routes request and response are generalized for different serverless providers
    - Includes express-like middleware out of the box
    - API routes can be deployed anywhere, but experience is easiest with ZEIT Now
  - [[Gatsby]] (Static pages, Netlify functions, deployed on Netlify)
    - `netlify.toml` defines location of AWS Lambda functions
    - Locked into AWS style, versus Next's more agnostic approach
- Vue
  - Nuxt.js
